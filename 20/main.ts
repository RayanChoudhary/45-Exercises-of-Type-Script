/*Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of
 mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.*/


 // Make an array of tripplaces
 let tripPlaces:string[] = ["cold desert","hunza","skardu","muree"];

 //print the message of list
console.log('list of trip places')

// print the values of array in a list form
 tripPlaces.forEach(trip => console.log(trip));
