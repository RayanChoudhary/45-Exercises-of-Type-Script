/*Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of
 mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.*/
// Make an array of tripplaces
var tripPlaces = ["cold desert", "hunza", "skardu", "muree"];
//print the message
console.log('list of trip places');
// use foreach method for list form
tripPlaces.forEach(function (trip) { return console.log(trip); });
